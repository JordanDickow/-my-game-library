<h1>My Game Library</h1>

<h1>About this Application</h1>

<p>I decided to follow my interests of video games to build my final project, My Game Library. This C.R.U.D application allows users to create and store their games in a game library. Users can retrieve all their games they have created  and are able to select  one game from the library to either update it's information, or delete the game from the library entirely.</p>

<h1> Set Up</h1>
<p> Clone this repository</p>
<p> Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies</p>
<p> Run 'npm run' to start the client</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p>I used React.js as the front end frame work to build the client. I really enjoyed how smooth React was updating the virtual DOM. For the backend I used Ruby on Rails.  Since learning about backend technologies, I've always liked Ruby on Rails feature to generate the files required to build out the API. I have since moved on to using Express for it's flexibility to hard code changes in the server with out needing to roll back.</p>

<h1>Future Iterations</h1>

<p>I envisioned the final product of this application to be a PS4 library clone. In the library itself it has a carousel effect. My plan for this project was to meet MVP so now that I can go back and improve it I want to use Material UI and work towards making it look more like a library.</p>
