You can use this app by insalling 'npm install' for react and 'bundle install' for Ruby.  

 I used React as my front end frame work. I added different components to meet all CRUD expectations and messaging to give feedback to the user after making an action.

 I had a tough time remembering authorization when switching my databases from a private read database to open read. Open read you're able to see other users entries but not edit them, private read you're only able to see your own entires.

 Also the deployed application has server errors even though the development app works fine.
